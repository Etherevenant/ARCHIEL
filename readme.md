# RHCSA 9 Prep Repo
This repo is a fork containing notes, a practice task list, and  general guidelines for building an RHEL lab.

## Layout
The site is broken into three main areas:
- Study Notes
- Lab Setup
- Exam Prep

## Study Notes
## Lab Setup - A g layout of how to build the lab and prep the servers for attempting the tasks in the exam prep task list.
## Exam Prep - Practice task list and a solution guide. 
Don't look at this as a "practice test", as the list of tasks here is considerably longer than what is required for the RHCSA exam. The task list is designed to cover every exam objective for the RHCSA 9 exam.
